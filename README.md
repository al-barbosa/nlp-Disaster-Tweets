This Jupyter Notebook was part of the Keegle Challenge to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict whether a tweet containing specific words normally associated with disasters (such as flames, fire, or annihilation) is cause of public conceirn.

The Database was very small, with a specific file for training and another for testing.

The process used involved the removal of punctuation and the reduction of words to the radical. In this way, words with a few different letters, but with the same field of idea (like fire and shot), were comparable.

Important to note is that removing stopwords actually resulted in worse accuracy for the models.
